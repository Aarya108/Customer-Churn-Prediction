# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In today's competitive business environment, customer retention is crucial for sustainable growth. This project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies customers likely to churn—i.e., discontinue using a service—based on their demographic details, subscription history, and usage patterns.

By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can accurately predict customer churn and enable businesses to implement personalized retention strategies, reduce churn rates, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize revenue.
